## F.A.Q. and common bugs

### Question: "Ermmmm... it freaking crashes?!/1!1?"
#### Answer:

#### In all seriousness, it's gonna crash sometimes maybe. From my testing it appears super stable and even instance teleporting works (slam dunk on windows multi instance). If you find things that make it crash, do make an issue because it would be nice to document them. That being said, there's absolutely nothing I can do about it.

### Question: What if it gets patched?

#### It's going to be. When it is, I will be obfuscating any new methods.
